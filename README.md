# WaterWise a FYP Project
A local company provides domestic water for citizens in a province. They
need a web application for administrators to manage equipment as well as
customers’ profiles and a mobile application for customer to track their
expenses on the water usage.
The project aims to build a database system to manage both equipment used
for building the water supply system and customers’ profile.
The company wants records of - Equipments’ details such as number of devices, installation date,
guarantee of each device, replacement period, technical parameters - Chemical used for processing water, quantity of used chemical, using
time - Equipment used for providing a water supply service for each
household and any problems with their water supply system - Volume of water used by each household, their historical bills and  - Staff responsible for providing each service to customers as well as
technical staff who is responsible for processing water - Time of each given service - Bank account of customers  
The database provides necessary information for administrators to manage
their facilities to maintain their services, update their stock, and manage staff
involved to water supply services. In addition, it helps to provide statistics of
water usage and payments of customers who can check details and pay bill via
their mobile application.
